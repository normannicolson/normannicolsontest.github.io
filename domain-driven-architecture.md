Mar 2018

> Domain driven architecture takes a domain driven design to architecture focusing on business understanding.

Domain driven design structures application solutions around business domain. Domain is business knowledge and processes. Domain Model is a codified conceptual model containing terms and business processes using business language (Ubiquitous Language).

Ubiquitous Language allows developers and business to clearly communicate effectively with each other.

Domain driven design focuses on solution and shared understanding rather than technology implementation details. The Domain model will outlive technology implementations.

Get started with Events and Things, connecting events.

For simple solutions one unified domain model with contain all business logic, for more complex systems require multiple models this separation is called bounded contexts, a bounded context can also be looked as a micro service boundary.
